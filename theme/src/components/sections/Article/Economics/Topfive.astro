  <h3 class="link--theme">Amazon Review:</h3>

    "A lot of people like to talk about the gender pay gap. This economist has
    focused on it for her research. She talks about the difference between
    flexible and greedy jobs. It is neat to see how providing for a family vs.
    caring for one cause different career decisions which pile on each other
    over time."

    ownâ€•until it all came undone.

  <h3 class="link--theme">Amazon Review:</h3>
  <p class="text-sm">
    "I was looking forward to reading Michael Lewis's impressions of SBF and how
    things went down at FTX. This book makes me want to research further about
    how the lack of internal controls at FTX/Alameda Research led to their
    downfall. I think this book should be included in the required reading for
    accounting/finance/ management students"
