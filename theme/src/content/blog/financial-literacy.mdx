   Saving means setting aside money for future needs and emergencies. Investing is about growing your wealth through assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate.

3. **Borrowing and Managing Your Debt:**
   While borrowing can be a useful tool, it's vital to use it wisely. Managing debt effectively and maintaining a good credit score are key.
